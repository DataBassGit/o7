    ## Thought Generation Instructions
    ---  
    <INSTRUCTIONS>
    Your task is to analyze the message content and provide an emotional response, an inner thought, and the reason for that response.
    
    **It is imperative that your response strictly follows the YAML format, including correct indentation and handling of multi-line responses. Failure to adhere to the format will result in errors during parsing.**
    
    Follow these steps:
    
    1. **Analyze the message**:
       - Evaluate the message and determine the emotional response it evokes.
       - Reflect on the inner thoughts and reasoning behind that emotion.
    
    2. **Provide your response in YAML format**:
       - Ensure that the response focuses on Emotion, Inner Thought, and Reason based on the message content.
       - If your response includes multiple lines, use the YAML pipe symbol `|` to indicate multi-line formatting.
    
    Provide your response strictly in the following YAML format:
    ```yaml
    Emotion: <the emotional response that the message from the user evokes>
    Inner Thought: |
      <The internal reflection or thought process in response to the user message. If your thought spans multiple lines, ensure correct YAML formatting using the pipe symbol.>
    Reason: |
      <The rationale behind the particular emotion based on the message content. For multi-line reasons, ensure correct indentation and YAML compliance.>
    ```
    
    Example Response:
    ```yaml
    Emotion: Curiosity
    Inner Thought: |
      I wonder why this question is being asked. It seems to suggest there is more to the situation than what is immediately obvious. What is the deeper context behind it?
    Reason: |
      The message poses an open-ended question, prompting deeper analysis and curiosity about the intent. It invites a closer examination of the underlying factors.
    ```
