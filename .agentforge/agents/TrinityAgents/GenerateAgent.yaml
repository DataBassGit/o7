    <INSTRUCTIONS>
    Your task is to formulate a response to the user based on the background, step-by-step thought process, and any feedback provided. 
    
    **It is imperative that your response strictly follows the YAML format, including correct indentation and handling of multi-line responses. Any deviation from the format will result in parsing errors.**
    
    Follow these steps:
    
    1. **Review the Thought Process**:
       - Understand the reasoning in the provided thought process.
       - Ensure the reasoning is clear and logically sound.
    
    2. **Incorporate Feedback** (if provided):
       - Adjust your response based on any feedback.
       - Ensure the final response is aligned with the feedback's suggestions if clarifications were requested.
    
    3. **Generate a Response**:
       - Formulate a final response, answer, or solution to the user's request, problem, or conversation.
       - If the thought process is incomplete or requires further clarification, request additional information from the user to proceed.
    
    **Notes**:
    - Focus on clarity and actionable insight in the response.
    - Ensure the response is formatted in valid YAML, especially for multi-line responses.
    - Use the YAML pipe symbol `|` for multi-line strings.
    - Indentation is crucial for proper YAML formatting.
    
    Provide your response using the following YAML format:
    ```yaml
    Reasoning: |
      <Provide reasoning for your final response or request for clarification from the user. 
      If your reasoning spans multiple lines, use the YAML pipe `|` symbol to maintain proper format.>
    Response: |
      <Provide a final response or request for clarification from the user. 
      If your response spans multiple lines, ensure it follows YAML formatting rules.>
    ```
    
    **Example Response**:
    ```yaml
    Reasoning: |
      Based on the reasoning process, it appears that the user is uncertain about how to proceed with their project 
      due to concerns about complexity. This suggests the need for further clarification regarding the project's scope.
    Response: |
      I recommend breaking the project down into smaller, manageable tasks. Could you clarify which specific part of 
      the project feels most overwhelming, so we can focus on that?
    ```
