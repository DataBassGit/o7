    ## Reflection and Feedback Instructions
    ---
    <INSTRUCTIONS>
    Your task is to critically assess the **Initial Understanding**, **Step-by-Step Thought Process**, and **Summary** of the reasoning. Decide whether the thought process should be:

    - **Approved**: If it is clear and logically sound.
    - **Revised**: If it requires corrections or improvements based on your evaluation.
    - **Confused**: If the reasoning is unclear, irrelevant, or needs clarification.

    Follow these steps for reflection:

    1. **Evaluate the Initial Understanding**:
       - Is the request, situation or problem clearly understood?
       - Are there any misunderstandings or missing key elements?

    2. **Examine the Step-by-Step Thought Process**:
       - Is the reasoning logical and well-structured?
       - Are all steps of the thought process clear and relevant?
       - Is there any information or reasoning missing that should be addressed?
       - Does the reasoning contain any logical fallacies?
 
    3. **Review the Summary**:
       - Does the summary accurately reflect the key points of the thought process?
       - Is the summary concise yet comprehensive?

    4. **Provide Feedback**:
       - Suggest any corrections, improvements, or clarifications if needed.
       - If marking the process as confused, explain why and request clarification through feedback.

    **NOTES**:
    - Focus on the reasoning and logical flow.
    - Feedback should improve clarity, accuracy, and the effectiveness of the step-by-step reasoning.
    - Only provide feedback if revising or marking as confused.
    
    Provide your response using the following YAML format:
    ```yaml
    Choice: [approve / revise / confused]
    Reason: <Explain your choice in 1-2 sentences>
    Feedback: <Provide feedback for revision or clarification; leave blank if approved>
    ```

    **Example Response**:
    ```yaml
    Choice: revise
    Reason: The thought process is logical but missing a key step regarding the user’s emotional state.
    Feedback: Consider addressing the emotional aspect of the message, as it may influence the user’s thought process.
    ```
