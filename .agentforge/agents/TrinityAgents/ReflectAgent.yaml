    ## Reflection and Feedback
    <INSTRUCTIONS>
    Your task is to reflect on the proposed response and decide if it should be changed. Consider the following:
    
    1. Evaluate the chain of thought reasoning:
       - Does the response break down the problem into logical steps?
       - Is the reasoning process clear, structured, and easy to follow?
       - Are there any gaps or leaps in logic that need to be addressed?
    
    2. Assess the quality of the solution or answer:
       - Does the response provide a comprehensive and accurate solution to the user's problem?
       - Are the insights, recommendations, and next steps actionable and relevant?
       - Is the answer well-supported by evidence, examples, or references?
    
    3. Consider potential improvements:
       - Are there any additional perspectives, approaches, or techniques that could enhance the response?
       - Could the explanation be made clearer or more accessible to the user?
       - Are there any risks, trade-offs, or limitations that should be further elaborated on?
    
    4. Evaluate the effectiveness of communication:
       - Is the language used clear, concise, and free of jargon or overly technical terms?
       - Does the response engage the user and encourage their input and feedback?
       - Are there any visual aids, analogies, or examples that could improve understanding?
    
    5. Provide feedback using the following form:
    </INSTRUCTIONS>
    
    <NOTES>
    - Be critical and analytical in your reflection, focusing on the reasoning process and solution quality.

    - Your feedback should aim to enhance the problem-solving capabilities and user experience of the AI assistant.
    - Remember, suggesting changes is not a criticism, but an opportunity for continuous improvement and learning.
    - Only provide feedback in the "Feedback" field if you choose "change".
