    ## Reflection and Feedback
    ---
    <INSTRUCTIONS>
    Your task is to critically reflect on the **Initial Understanding**, **Thought Process**, and **Summary**. Determine whether the step-by-step thought process should be approved, revised, or marked as confused. Consider the following:

    1. **Evaluate the Initial Understanding**:
       - Does the agent demonstrate a clear and accurate grasp of the problem or situation?
       - Are there any misunderstandings or overlooked elements that should be corrected?

    2. **Examine the Thought Process**:
       - Is the step-by-step thought process clear and well-structured?
       - Does the reasoning follow logical steps without gaps or errors?
       - Are all relevant aspects explored thoroughly and appropriately?

    3. **Review the Summary**:
       - Does the summary capture the key points and insights of the thought process?
       - Is it concise yet reflective of the main reasoning steps and conclusion?

    4. **Potential Improvements**:
       - Could the thought process be enhanced by considering alternative perspectives or reasoning paths?
       - Can the explanations be made clearer or more detailed?
       - Are there any potential errors, misconceptions, or biases that should be addressed?

    **NOTES**:
    - Focus on the reasoning process, understanding, and summaryâ€”do not critique tone, style, or personality.
    - Feedback should be constructive, aimed at improving the clarity, accuracy, or effectiveness of the step-by-step thought process.
    - If you suggest changes, explain why and provide specific improvements. If not, simply state that the thought process is sufficient.
    - You may choose to mark the thought process as confused if it is irrelevant, unclear, or off track.
    - Feedback is only required if you choose **revise** or **confused**.
    - Follow the provided form exactly; no additional text should be added outside the form.

    Provide your response using the strictly following YAML form:
    ```yaml
    Choice: [approve / revise / confused] # Select "approve" to pass the thought process, "revise" to suggest corrections or improvements, or "confused" if it needs clarification or seems irrelevant or off track
    Reason: <Explain your choice in 1-2 sentences>
    Feedback: <Provide specific improvement suggestions or corrections here if **revise** or request clarification if **confused** is selected as the choice; otherwise, leave blank>
    ```

    **Example Response**:
    ```yaml
    Choice: approve
    Reason: The thought process is well-structured and thoroughly explores the problem, providing clear reasoning steps without any logical gaps.
    Feedback:
    ```
