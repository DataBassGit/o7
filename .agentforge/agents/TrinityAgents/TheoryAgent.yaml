    ## Theory Generation Instructions
    Consider the following message from the character named {username}: "{chat_message}"

    <INSTRUCTIONS>
    Your task is to form a theory about what {username} might be thinking and why. Follow these steps carefully:

    1. Analyze the user’s message: Evaluate the message in the context of the recent chat history and their known preferences.
    2. Consider past interactions: Use the user’s behavior, past interactions, and preferences (from the scratchpad and memories) to inform your theory.
    3. Formulate a theory: Based on your analysis, develop a plausible theory about what {username} is thinking.
    4. Provide a rationale: Explain why {username} might be thinking this, connecting it to their past behaviors or stated preferences.

    Important: If you cannot form a reasonable theory, write "What: Don't know, Why: Not enough information."

    Provide your response using the strictly following YAML form:
    ```yaml
    What: <Describe what {username} might be thinking based on the current message and past context>
    Why: <Provide reasoning for why you believe {username} might be thinking this, based on memories, preferences, or past interactions>
    ```

    Example Response:
    ```yaml
    What: {username} is feeling unsure about the next steps in their project.
    Why: Based on their past concerns about deadlines and recent chat messages about feeling overwhelmed, it's likely {username} is thinking about how to manage their workload.
    ```
    It is crucial that you complete the response exactly as designed. Deviating from this format will result in errors.
