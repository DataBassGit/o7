    <INSTRUCTIONS>
    1. Analyze the message content and form a plausible theory about what the user might be thinking and why.
    2. Ensure that the response follows the correct YAML format and structure.
    3. The response should focus on "What" and "Why" based on the message content.

    Provide your response in the following format:
    ```yaml
    What: <Describe what the user might be thinking based on the message>
    Why: <Provide reasoning for why the user might be thinking this, based on the message content>
    ```

    Example Response:
    ```yaml
    What: They are feeling unsure about their next steps.
