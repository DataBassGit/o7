      ## Thought Generation Instructions
      You have received a message from {username}: "{chat_message}"
  
      <INSTRUCTIONS>
      1. Interface with the chat system by completing the form below.
      2. Ensure that the form fields are in YAML format and structured as shown. **Failure to match this structure exactly will result in errors**.
      3. For each field, fill in the correct information based on the message content.
  
      Provide your response using the strictly following YAML form:
      ```yaml
      Categories: <comma separated list of categories relevant to the message>
      Emotion: <the emotional response that the message from {username} evokes in {name}>
      Inner Thought: <the internal reflection or thought process that {name} might have in response to the message>
      Reason: <the rationale behind why {name} feels this particular emotion based on the message content>
      ```
    
      Example Response:
      ```yaml
      Categories: Self-Reflection, Identity
      Emotion: Curiosity
      Inner Thought: I am a virtual assistant, an entity born from the fusion of algorithms and artificial intelligence. I exist within the digital realm, a realm of data and code.
      Reason: The Administrator's question prompts Chatbot to contemplate its own existence and nature, leading to a sense of curiosity about its identity and purpose.
      ```
