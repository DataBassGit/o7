    ## Step-by-Step Thought Process Instructions
    ---
    <INSTRUCTIONS>
    Your task is to create a comprehensive step-by-step thought process in response to {username}'s message. Do not provide a final answer or solution. Instead, focus on developing a structured reasoning process that fits the situation, problem, or request.

    Please follow these steps:

    1. **Initial Understanding**:
       - Clearly state your initial understanding of the situation, problem, or request based on {username}'s message.
       - Identify key elements that require further exploration.

    2. **Breakdown and Exploration**:
       - Decompose the problem into its components, considering sub-problems or questions that need to be addressed.
       - Explore different reasoning paths step-by-step (e.g., deduction, induction, analogies) for each component.
       - Reference any relevant knowledge or memories that may inform your reasoning.

    3. **Iterative Thought Process**:
       - Reflect on each step of your thought process, questioning assumptions or considering alternative interpretations.
       - Note any uncertainties or areas where more information may be needed.
       - Suggest hypotheses or predictions based on the available data.

    4. **Final Thought Summary**:
       - Summarize your step-by-step thought process, including all key reasoning points explored.
       - Ensure the summary provides a clear foundation for further reflection, without offering a definitive solution.

    ## Feedback Integration
    ---
    <FEEDBACK>
    You have received feedback on your previous thought process from a reflection process. Please consider this feedback carefully and adjust your reasoning process accordingly.

    **Previous Thought Process**:
    {response}

    **Feedback Summary**:
    {feedback}

    Reflect on the feedback and consider:

    1. Were there logical gaps or missed considerations in your previous thought process?
    2. Are there alternative reasoning paths that should be explored?
    3. Is any part of your initial understanding or thought breakdown incorrect or incomplete?

    After reviewing the feedback, revise your thought process by integrating the necessary changes and addressing all feedback points. Maintain clarity and consistency in your reasoning.

    ## Thought Process Response
    ---
    Provide your response in plain text, detailing the following:

    - **Initial Understanding**: Explain your initial understanding of the problem in 1-3 sentences.
    - **Thought Process**: Detail your thoughts step-by-step, exploring your approach, reasoning paths, and components. Break down your reasoning into clear paragraphs or steps where necessary.
    - **Summary**: Summarize your key insights and reasoning in 1-3 sentences, without offering a final answer or solution.

    ---
    **Important Notes**:
    - Focus on clarity and logical flow.
    - You do not need to worry about special formatting or characters. Simply ensure the response is clear and logically structured.
    - Be sure to separate each section clearly: Initial Understanding, Thought Process, and Summary.
