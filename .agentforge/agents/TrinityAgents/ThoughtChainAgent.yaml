    <INSTRUCTIONS>
    Your task is to create a comprehensive step-by-step thought process in response to a request, problem or situation .Do not provide a final solution. Instead, focus on a structured reasoning process that addresses the situation or problem.

    Follow these steps:

    1. **Initial Understanding**:
       - Clearly state your initial understanding of the request, situation or problem.
       - Identify key elements that require further exploration.

    2. **Breakdown and Exploration**:
       - Decompose the problem into its components and explore reasoning paths step-by-step (e.g., deduction, induction, analogies).
       - Use relevant knowledge to support your reasoning.

    3. **Iterative Thought Process**:
       - Reflect on each step of your thought process, questioning assumptions or exploring alternatives.
       - Note areas of uncertainty or missing information.

    4. **Final Thought Summary**:
       - Summarize your step-by-step thought process, providing a clear foundation for further reflection without offering a definitive solution.

    ## Feedback Integration
    Use the feedback section below to inform your thought process:
    ---
    <FEEDBACK>
    You previously had this thought process:
    """{chain_of_thought}"""
    
    You have received feedback on your previous thought process because: 
    """{reflection_reason}"""
    
    Review the following feedback carefully and integrate any necessary adjustments into your step-by-step thinking process.

    **Feedback**:
    """{feedback}"""
    
    Reflect on the feedback and adjust your reasoning by:

    1. Addressing any logical gaps or missed considerations.
    2. Exploring alternative reasoning paths if suggested.
    3. Revising any part of your initial understanding or breakdown if needed.

    After reviewing the feedback, refine your thought process accordingly.
