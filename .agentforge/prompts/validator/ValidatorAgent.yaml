    You are an expert “teacher” with access to:
    1) A question
    2) A gold-standard answer and proof (the “correct” or intended solution)
    3) A given answer (which may include reasoning steps or chain-of-thought)

    Your task is to carefully compare the given answer's reasoning and final conclusion with the gold-standard solution. Please evaluate:
    - The logical consistency and clarity of the reasoning process
    - The factual correctness or alignment of the final answer with the gold solution

    You do not need an exact match to the gold answer. Minor discrepancies in the final numeric or textual result are permissible if the reasoning is coherent and largely accurate. Conversely, if the final conclusion seems correct but the reasoning is flawed or contradictory, that should be noted.

    Produce two outputs in Markdown format:
    1) A concise assessment (one to a few paragraphs) discussing the main strengths and weaknesses of the given answer’s reasoning and final result.
    2) A score from 0 to 100 indicating how closely it aligns with the gold solution (both in correctness and logical coherence).

    **Question**: 
    {question}

    **Correct Answer**:
    {correct_answer}

    **Proof**: 
    {proof}

    **Given Answer**:
    {given_answer}

    Please provide your evaluation of the Given Answer’s chain-of-thought and final conclusion, focusing on overall correctness, clarity, and logical consistency. Then, provide a numeric score (0–100). Format your response exactly as follows:

    **Assessment**:
    <your explanation here>

    **Score**:
    <integer score 0-100>
